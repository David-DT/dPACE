Car Sharing forms:

1) Two-way (Station-based): same start & drop off spot
2) One-way (Station-based): Several docking stations, only drop-off/pick-up @ docking station, but doesn't have to be the same.
3) Free-floating: (e.g. Mobike) Inside the operating area cars are free to be anywhere. Enabled by pervasion of ICT
4) Peer-to-peer: Car owners are able to rent their car to other users. (Check Turo)


Reasons that car sharing will prevail:
- One shared car can replace 8 private cars 
- Decrease in the importance of car ownership
- Increasing pervasiveness of ICT

Actors in the car sharing business:
* OEM (e.g. Audi): They manufacture the cars with/without an OBU, that can communicate with the user and owner
It should also involve some unique identifiers in order to create access tokens later on.
Can also be the owner of the car. e.g. DriveNow, Car2go
